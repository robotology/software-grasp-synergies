Welcome to the version 0.8 of the TypeSafeBottles.

The typesafebottles are yarp bottles that support typesafety for sending messages across modules.

The typesafe bottles ARE bottles, as they inherit from the bottle class. The folder is self contained and have everything needed to develop your module using typesafe bottles either for communication or parsing a config file. For sample code, please refer to the GraspModule.

The bottles come in three versions, VectorBottles, StructBottles and WrapperBottles and are fully backward compatible with the original typesafe bottles.

Further documentation can be found in YarpTypeSafeBottles.pptx, presented at VVV2014 Summer School and on the main documentation file.

The software is released under GPL 2.0 and later versions and the work leading to their release has been supported by EC FP7 Project DARWIN. Copyright 2013 King's College london.

The typesafe bottles have been developed by Kris De Meyer and tested by Giuseppe Cotugno, while the software is given "as it is" you might try to get in touch with us if you like.

Have fun!
