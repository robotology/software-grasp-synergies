{"name":"Software-grasp-synergies","tagline":"Module implementing grasping synergies in software for the iCub hand and TypeSafe Bottles release","body":"Welcome to the first release of the Software Grasping Synergies Module!\r\n=====================================================================\r\n\r\nThis module implements grasping synergies in software for the iCub hand. The module allows to grasp a wide variety of objects and is developed on YARP for the iCub.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm is described in the publication _Simplifying Grasping Complexity through Generalization of Kinaesthetically Learned Synergies, G. Cotugno, V. Mohan, K. Althoefer, T. Nanayakkara, ICRA 2014_ freely downloadable from Giuseppe's page on thrish.org. \r\n\r\nThe module objects like markers, cuboids, and many others described in the paper, can be grasped using a power grasp or a pinch grip. The module can be easily extended with other grasping primitives by modifying the config files as described in the documentation.\r\n\r\nSince publication date, the code has been refactored and re-engineered and is much faster and efficient than before. Please refer to the changelog on the documentation's mainpage for details.\r\n\r\nThis module differs from other YARP modules as it intensively uses TypeSafeBottles, that is a type safe backward compatible extension of YARP bottles. A preliminary release of the TypeSafeBottles is included in the repository.\r\n\r\nThe module uses the bottles for parsing the config file, the required components are in the src folder.\r\nIt is possible (but not mandatory) to communicate with the module using typesafe bottles, the specifications and components are in the \"messages\" folder. This self-contained folder contains all the required elements to use typesafe bottles in your own projects for communication or file parsing.\r\n\r\nIf you plan to use the module for your research, please cite the above paper as a reference.\r\n\r\nThis module has been developed on YARP version 2.3.22 and has been tested on Linux and Windows.\r\n\r\nFor queries on this module please contact the authors Giuseppe Cotugno and Kris De Meyer (giuseppe.cotugno_at__kcl.ac.uk)\r\n\r\nHave fun!\r\n\r\nThe development of this module and the TypeSafeBottles have been supported by EC FP7 DARWIN Project, Grant No. 270138. \r\nWebsite: http://darwin-project.eu/\r\n\r\nCopyright 2013, King's College London, Released under GPL v2 and later versions.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
