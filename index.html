<p>This module implements grasping synergies in software for the iCub hand. The module allows to grasp a wide variety of objects and is developed on YARP for the iCub.</p>

<p>The algorithm is described in the publication <em>Simplifying Grasping Complexity through Generalization of Kinaesthetically Learned Synergies, G. Cotugno, V. Mohan, K. Althoefer, T. Nanayakkara, ICRA 2014</em> freely downloadable from Giuseppe's page on thrish.org. </p>

<p>The module objects like markers, cuboids, and many others described in the paper, can be grasped using a power grasp or a pinch grip. The module can be easily extended with other grasping primitives by modifying the config files as described in the documentation.</p>

<p>Since publication date, the code has been refactored and re-engineered and is much faster and efficient than before. Please refer to the changelog on the documentation's mainpage for details.</p>

<p>This module differs from other YARP modules as it intensively uses TypeSafeBottles, that is a type safe backward compatible extension of YARP bottles. A preliminary release of the TypeSafeBottles is included in the repository.</p>

<p>The module uses the bottles for parsing the config file, the required components are in the src folder.
It is possible (but not mandatory) to communicate with the module using typesafe bottles, the specifications and components are in the "messages" folder. This self-contained folder contains all the required elements to use typesafe bottles in your own projects for communication or file parsing.</p>

<p>If you plan to use the module for your research, please cite the above paper as a reference.</p>

<p>This module has been developed on YARP version 2.3.22 and has been tested on Linux and Windows.</p>

<p>For queries on this module please contact the authors Giuseppe Cotugno and Kris De Meyer (giuseppe.cotugno_at__kcl.ac.uk)</p>

<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>The development of this module and the TypeSafeBottles have been supported by EC FP7 DARWIN Project, Grant No. 270138.
